## Service Worker Details

The service worker is configured to:

- Precache static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files.
- Use different caching strategies for different types of resources.
- Handle push notifications and background sync for offline functionality.

### Caching Strategies

- **Network First**: Ensures users get the latest content when online.
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Balances speed and freshness for frequently updated files.
- **Cache First**: Optimized for static assets like images and audio.

## Technologies Used

- **Workbox**: For managing service worker and caching strategies.
- **HTML5**: For the app's structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling.
